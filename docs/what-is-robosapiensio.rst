What is robosapiensIO?
======================

**Developing and commissioning trustworthy self-adaptive systems made easy!**

    :local:

robosapiensIO is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, toolkit for developing
trustworthy self-adaptive systems, using the updated MAPE-K pattern.

Philosophy
----------

robosapiensIO's unique philosophy in the robotics community provides developers with a modern integrated development environment
that works cross-platform, enabling to build and commission trustworthy self-adaptive (robotics) systems using the MAPLE-K pattern.

And it runs on any one of your favorite modern operating systems (macOS, MS Windows, Linux).

How does it work?
-----------------

Without going too deep into robosapiensIO implementation details, work cycle of
the project developed using robosapiensIO is as follows:

* Users develops the conceptual model of the self-adaptive system using RoboArch
* An AADL model is generated from the defined RoboArch model
* User annotates the generated AADL model with deployment-specific elements
* A project deployment package, including code skeletons, launch files, etc., is generated from the annotated AADL model
* User can add user-specific code to implement the self-adaptive system behavior
* Based on the project deployment package, user can perform actions to build, deploy and execute the self-adaptive system
